As Gin takes a year off, her parents stops financially supporting her on everything including clothes, food expenses, transportation fees to get to places(she lives in a city), and even phone bill.
Basically, they wanted her to be independent for the gap year, but Gin is not ready for this big step and doesn&#8217;t know what to do. In addition, her sudden health problems make everything worse. Then, Gin feels the pain of being broke and has the toughest moment of her life&mdash;two terrible part time jobs that don&#8217;t go well, her sudden change of health makes it impossible for her to do any physical labors, meets some stupid boys, and she experiences the loss of everything. After the adventures, she then tries to learn what real happiness is about. &ldquo;Does money really make you happy? Boys? Good jobs?&rdquo; She starts to let go of her greed&mdash;no fancy clothes, purses, shoes, or cosmetics. She learns making the most out of what she already has&mdash;family, friends, biking, photography, and just relaxing and enjoying being back home. As she starts letting go of her desire for material wealth, she actually gains more. This is ironic because she used to think that desire for wealth is the key to succeed, but it was not. Gin actually finds a way to go off of on her own as she starts seeing better value in doing things as biking, drawing, taking photos, spending time with her family and friends, helping others people, and etc. How ironic.

    <li class="read-more-target"><br><br>This transition is hard for Gin especially because she is a type of girl who is into fashion, food, going out and meeting people. Having no income, being incapable of getting jobs due to health problems, and yet still wanting to do all the things that are sources of energy of her life. What a new challenge and adjustment. Clothes. Friends. Food. None of these can be out of Gin&#8217;s life, but can she still do them all with no income?</span></li>
