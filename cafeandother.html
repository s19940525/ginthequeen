$5 VACATION IN SEOUL!</center>
</div>



<div class="text-body">

	Last summer, we&apos;ve been wanting to visit <i>Cafe &amp; Other</i>, a unique summer-y themed cafe in Seongsu.<br>
	But we&apos;ve been putting off till fall, and we finally decided to visit.<br>
	<br>
	Seoul is a big city, a 3/4 of NYC (land size wise), but more population.
	So, there are people EVERYWHERE.<br>
	There also are many wonderful places to eat, tour, and rest.<br>
	In Korea, cafes are the most common and popular places to hang and chill.<br>
	And Seongsu has just been starting to grow recently to have unique cafes, so I thought we would check one of them out.<br>

	Why not chat in a prettier cafe and have more fun?<br>
	<br><br>
	So, we went to Cafe &amp; Other, which has been famous all summer this year, and still is because...
	<br><br>

	<br><br>
	Because of this pool they have!<br>
	<br>
	When you enter, there is a pool right in the middle of the yard.<br>
	A pool in a cafe? How revolutionary!<br>
	<br><br>

	If you haven&apos;t gone on a summer vacation like myself, it might be a good idea to go to this place, take a break from a busy city life for a day, and just chill.

	Everyone seemed hesitant to get on the deck that has the pool and sun bed, but when I got there, I walked in with full of confidence and laid on the sun bed. C&apos;mon, isn&apos;t this what you came here for?

Look at these drinks. The aesthetic though. Did the cafe owner major in art? <br>
They&apos;ve got more aesthetic than any artwork I&apos;ve made in my entire life..<br>
<br><br>

<br>
I named this drink a pool water drink because the color matches the water of the pool.<br> I would&apos;ve believed if they said they poured it right out of the pool.<br>
Jk. Why would I believe that. I&apos;d probably complain because thousands of people have put their feet in this pool.<br>
<br><br>

<br>
After doing a queen-roleplay for a good amount of time with the beautiful set up, we went inside to have a in-depth conversation with Minju, such as “what time is good for you to have fried chicken with me”.<br>
<br>
The beautiful yard with a pool isn&apos;t it, cafe has first and second floors and a rooftop. And the interior of each floor is very beautiful, so don&apos;t forget to check em out!<br><br><br><br><br><br>
